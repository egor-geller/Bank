# Bank account management assignment

Implement a Python program (which will run by calling a single script) 
in which you will implement the management of a single bank account 
with the following actions (by INPUT from the user)

1. Opening a bank account - enter data such as the name of the account holder, social security number, and any data you believe is necessary and will serve your plan.
2. Check balance - by printing to the screen.
3. Money deposit - a description must be added to the type of currency, amount, bank account, etc.
4. Withdrawing money - as above.
5. Output of recent movements (how many movements?) should be printed to the screen in an orderly manner
6. Saving account transaction pages as a text file.
7. Calculation of various statistics on account operations - average deposits/withdrawals, etc.
8. Reasonable judgment must be exercised wherever you have to make decisions about this or that exercise.
9. We must use as much diversity as possible of the Python language in order to combine as many things as possible that we have learned.
10. Submission: 
    - A Python script that runs the program.
    - Tests that check at least five different actions from the program - note that the tests should give input to the program (SYS)
